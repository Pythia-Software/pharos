# Handoffs

Each file here is a self-contained assignment for an agent. It says what to
change, the evidence for the problem, where to start, and when the work is
done.

The handoffs below came out of the test-suite work in
[`docs/testing-survey.md`](../testing-survey.md) (PRs #143–#157). They assume
that work has landed: start from a `master` that includes #157. Follow
[`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) for test commands and the rules for writing
tests.

## Product bugs

| Handoff | Problem |
|---|---|
| [usage-filtered-metrics-fast-path.md](usage-filtered-metrics-fast-path.md) | Filtered Usage cost and distinct-count metrics still take the slow path; confirm Machine Time's all-time CPU |
| [query-table-fork-reduction-reuse.md](query-table-fork-reduction-reuse.md) | Our patched Query Table adapter re-scans the source when `AVG` or `MIN` is batched with `SUM` |
| [query-table-schema-reload.md](query-table-schema-reload.md) | Every staged Query Table request makes its connection re-parse the whole catalog schema twice, adding about 6 ms of CPU |

## Upstream Query Table

Requests for the Query Table library itself are collected in
[`docs/query-table-next-release-handoff.md`](../query-table-next-release-handoff.md):

- **QT-14:** fuse metrics over different fields in one pass, so Pharos can
  delete its native count and sum path.
- **QT-15:** let computed-column previews use the negotiated transport, so
  Pharos can retire its legacy row route.
